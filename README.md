# yourPlace MERN CRUD Backend Guide

This repository contains the backend codebase for the "yourPlace" MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) CRUD application. The backend handles various functionalities such as user authentication, place management, image storage, and more. This README provides an overview of the repository and its commit history.

## Getting Started

To set up the backend on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd yourPlace-MERN-CRUD-backend-guide`.
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Configure your environment variables. Create a `.env` file and add the necessary configurations (e.g., MongoDB connection string, AWS S3 credentials, JWT secret, etc.).
5. Run the backend server: `npm start`.
